Write python script to implement the simple network shown in the figure below

1. This network consists of 4 nodes (no, n1, n2, n3)

2. The duplex links between no and n2, and n1 and n2 have 2 Mbps of

bandwidth and 10 ms of delay.

3. The duplex link between n2 and n3 has 1.7 Mbps of bandwidth and 20 ms

of delay.

4. Each node uses a DropTail queue, of which the maximum size is 10. You

will have to orient the nodes as shown in the diagram below.

5. A "tcp" agent is attached to n1, and a connection is established to a tcp

"sink" agent attached to n3.

6. A tcp "sink" agent generates and
sends ACK packets to the sender (tcp

agent) and frees the received packets.
7. A "udp" agent that is attached to no is connected to a "null" agent attached to

n3. A "nu11" agent just frees the packets received.

8. A "ftp" and a "cbr" traffic generator are attached to "tcp" and "udp" agents

respectively, and the "cbr" is configured to generate packets having size of 1

Kbytesat the rate of 100 packets per second.

9. FTP will control the traffic automatically according to the throttle

mechanism  in TCP.

1 0.The traffic flow of UDP must be colored red and traffic flow of TCP must be

colored blue.

11. The "cbr" is set to start at 0.1 sec and stop at 4.5 sec,

12. "ftp" is set to start at 0.5 sec and stop at 4.0 sec.
